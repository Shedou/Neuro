Using the -s/--source, -t/--target and -o/--output argument will run the program in headless mode.

--------------------Advanced-Options--------------------

--- Using Acceleration ---
option: --execution-provider
default: cpu

Depending on what onnxruntime package you installed, specify the respective execution provider with this option to utilize your GPU. Below is a list of popular execution providers, the complete list can be found here. If you are not sure, use the --help option to see the available providers in your console.

cuda: for NVIDIA
rocm: for AMD (linux only)
dml: for windows
coreml: for mac


--- Choosing a frame processor ---
option: --frame-processor
default: face_swapper

This option lets you choose one or more "frame processor" that apply various affect to the video. If you are using multiple processors, they should be separated by spaces. Following frame processors are available:

face_swapper: swaps face(s)
face_enhancer: enhances the face(s) using GFPGAN v1.4


--- Preserving video's FPS ---
option: --keep-fps
default: False

roop reduces the FPS of the video to 30 by default for faster processing but if you would like to preserve the original FPS, you can use this switch.


--- Keep generated frames ---
option: --keep-frames
default: False

While processing a video, roop extracts all of its frames and stores them locally. The directory containing them is deleted once the process has been finished. Using --keep-frames switch will prevent deletion.


--- Replace all faces ---
option: --many-faces
default: False

By default, only one face is replaced in each frame that too the leftmost face in the frame. If you want to replace all of the faces, use this switch.


--- Choose a video encoder ---
option: --video-encoder
default: libx264

This lets you choose a video encoder, currently available encoders are: libx264, libx265, libvpx-vp9`


--- Set video quality ---
option: --video-quality
default: 18

You wouldn't need to touch this option but in case you do, it accepts an number from 1 to 51.


--- Limit RAM ---
option: --max-memory
default: None

If you want to limit how much RAM roop can use, use this option. It accepts a number e.g. --max-memory 4 means 4GB limit.


--- Execution Threads ---
option: --execution-threads
default: system dependent

This control how many threads should run in parallel to process the frames using the given execution provider. Play around with different values to find out what works best on your system.
